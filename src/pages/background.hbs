      <p>I earned my masterâ€™s degree in counseling psychology from Lewis & Clark College. I have worked in community mental health, a small agency setting, and private practice providing counseling with diverse populations experiencing a broad range of symptoms and struggles, such as trauma, shame, gender-identity issues, anxiety, and depression, through one on one and group facilitation. I have also completed my training to become an approved supervisor for LPC and LMFT interns.</p>

      <p>On a more personal note I love to read anything from therapy books, sci-fi, fantasy, and novels. After a long day, I like to play a game of cribbage or Ms. Pac-Man. It is also common to find a partially finished puzzle on my kitchen table.</p>
